SUMMARY="Simple, fast, safe, compiled language for developing maintainable software"
HOMEPAGE="https://vlang.io/"
DESCRIPTION="
V is a statically typed compiled programming language designed for building maintainable software.
It's similar to Go and its design has also been influenced by Oberon, Rust, Swift, Kotlin, and Python.
V is a very simple language. Going through this documentation will take you about a weekend, and by the end of it you will have pretty much learned the entire language.
The language promotes writing simple and clear code with minimal abstraction.
Despite being simple, V gives the developer a lot of power. Anything you can do in other languages, you can do in V.
